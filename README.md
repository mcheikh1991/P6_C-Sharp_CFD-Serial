# Project 6: C# CFD Serial Project
The current repository presents codes that implement a c# version of one of the most common partial differential equations, the Burgers’ equation. The equation
is named after Johannes Martinus Burgers, and has applications in various areas of applied mathematics, such as fluid dynamics, nonlinear acoustics, molecular gas dynamics, and traffic flow. 

This project is a first step into writting a parallelized version of the Burgers’ equation in C#.
